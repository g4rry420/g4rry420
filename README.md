# Hi there 👋🏼

## I'm Gurkiran Singh

I'm a enthusiatic developer and tech-savvy, actively remain on the watch for new tech products. I like _learning about how things work_ and am _fascinated about how computers work_.

### 🛠 Skillset

My primary interest is in _**Web Development**_, and I've been writing web stack code since the last 1.5 years. I particularly love working on the _front-end_. I have good knowledge of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, with further experience in `React` and some `ember`. Of late, I prefer using `TypeScript` over `JavaScript`. On the _front-end_, other technologies I've used are `JQuery`, `Bootstrap`, `Webpack`, `Material-UI`, `SCSS`, etc. On the _back-end_, I've some experience with `Node` (plus `Express`), and `PHP`.On the database side, I have decent amount of knowledge in `Firebase`, `MySQL`, `Postgresql` and `MongoDB`. I'm familiar with _REST_ and I've testing experience with `Jest` and `Mocha`.Moreover, I am also familar with cloud technologies, particularly AWS -  `Lambda`, `Amplify`, `S3`, `IAM` and `DynamoDb`.

### 🌱 Interests

Apart from `Coding`, you can talk with me about _**airplanes**_:airplane:, _**nba**_:basketball:, _**paintings**_ and _**dogs**_:dog:. If you want to share your interests, I'be to happy to talk with you. Just ping me:blush:

[//]: # (### 🔭 Working on ...)

[//]: # (I'm currently contributing in [_**Grommet**_]https://github.com/grommet/grommet/ which is `React` based design system for the UI made using the Storybook. The goal is to take on the challenges encountered due to the original architecture, and build a more robust and reliable application, from the ground up. I also have plans to undertake the development of a _**Physics World**_ simulating _Dynamics_, to aid high school students.)

[//]: # (### 📚 Learning ...)

[//]: # (I've started learning the `Rust` programming language and `Web Assembly` paraphernalia. Lately, I've been inquisitive about architecture of software and systems. I'm reading a book titled _"Linux Kernel Development"_ by _Robert Love_. I want to dive into embedded systems programming soon.)
